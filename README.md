Authors: 654wak654, the0utsider
Features:
- Positional in-game audio for units, for each faction, randomized
- Using 'say3D' and 'playsound3D' for realistic volume simulation
- Max. range distance of sounds are similar to ingame directChat
- Loud shout of pain whenever a unit dies
- Wounded unit sentences 
- Friendly fire warnings
- Target down at close (less than 150 meters): aggressive kill confirms (depends on randomized chance factor)
- Target down (outside 150m range): calm kill confirms (depends on randomized chance factor)
- Whenever a team member gets killed nearby, alive team members shout panic sentences (depends on randomized chance factor)
- Unit using throwables: shouts for throwing frag grenade and smoke grenades
- Unit will let the others around know that he has few magazines left on him
- Unit will say that he just planted an explosive satchel or c4 charge
- Unit will say similar sentences to "watchout while I reload" when current mag goes empty
- Performance demand of this add-on is minimal as It uses no loops and nothing is added to Arma scheduler
- approx. 700 different sound samples

Description:
Using NWI's iconic game 'insurgency' sound samples, this add-on created to improve overall experience and bring dynamism to expressionless Arma3 models. I always imagined this to be something similar to st_hud but an aural one instead of visual. Each faction has their own sounds, with samples played on certain actions to increase situational awareness, to simulate better close quarters combat.
