# Goko Unit Voiceovers
Dynamic, randomized 3D positional sound samples for units

Authors: 654wak654, the0utsider

Using NWI's iconic game 'insurgency' sound samples, this add-on created to improve overall experience and bring dynamism to expressionless Arma3 models. I always imagined this to be something similar to st_hud but an aural one instead of visual. Each faction has their own sounds, with samples played on certain actions to increase situational awareness, to simulate better close quarters combat.

**Features:**
- Complete overhaul for default arma unit voice-overs
- Opfor, independent, blufor sides use their own different set of voices
- Randomized samples on each action for diversity
- Spot enemy / callout targets direction (Default key 'T')
- ACE3 compatibility: supports ace grenade types
- works independent from 'enablesentences false' setting; using its own EH framework
- almost 1000 different sound samples total
- 'spot enemy' feature:This is similar to tactical ping, only an aural one to quickly alert your group. It uses 'knowsAbout' command; according to weather, time of day and distance of enemy soldier, player will call out enemies direction. If 'knowsabout' value return zero, function won't work.

**Customization:**
* CBA is required to enable add-on options
- Enable/disable VOs for player/client
- Sound sample pitch adjustment
- Set volume level and travel distance to your liking
- Ratio customization for certain sounds
- Rebind/change 'Target Spot' key via CBA add-on controls

**Dynamic voice-overs when:**
- clip goes empty/reloading,
- shooting enemy,
- being shot at,
- getting wounded,
- hurting a friendly,
- spotting enemy,
- using throwable items,
- low on ammo,
- hostile throw grenade at you,
- a teammate nearby is killed,
- planting charges.
