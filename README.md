**Description**

Using NWI's 'Insurgency' sound samples, this mod was created to improve the overall experience and bring dynamism to the in-game voices in Arma 3.

Gokmen: I always imagined this to be something similar to st_hud but an aural one instead of visual. Each faction has their own sounds, with samples played on certain actions to increase situational awareness and to simulate better close quarters combat.

**Features**
- Complete overhaul for default arma unit voice-overs
- Opfor, independent, and blufor sides use different sets of voices
- Randomized samples on each action
- Spot enemy / callout targets direction (Default key 'T')
- ACE3 Medical compatibility
- Independent from 'enablesentences false' setting
- Almost 1000 different sound samples total
- Supports transferring unit locality

**Customization**
- Enable/disable VOs for player
- Sound sample pitch adjustment
- Set volume level and travel distance to your liking
- Ratio customization for certain sounds
- Rebind/change 'Target Spot' key via CBA add-on controls
- Custom faction/nationality sound declaration system
- Single unit disable function

**Dynamic voice-overs when:**
- Magazine goes empty/reloading
- Enemy visibly killed
- Getting wounded
- Friendly fire
- Player spots enemy
- Using throw-able or plant-able items
- Low on ammo
- A hostile frag is thrown nearby
- A nearby friendly is killed
