[h1]Description:[/h1]
Dynamic, randomized 3D positional sound samples for units in Arma

Using NWI's [url=https://newworldinteractive.com/#insurgency]Insurgency[/url] sound samples, this mod was created to improve the overall experience and bring dynamism to the in-game voices in Arma 3.

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
	[*] Complete overhaul for default arma unit voice-overs
	[*] Opfor, independent, and blufor sides use different sets of voices
	[*] Randomized samples on each action
	[*] Spot enemy / callout targets direction (Default key 'T')
	[*] ACE3 Medical compatibility
	[*] Works independent from 'enablesentences false' setting
	[*] Almost 1000 different sound samples total
	[*] Supports transferring unit locality
[/list]
  [i]  Unit has to have friendlies nearby (40 meters) in order to emit feedback voices. 
Solo/alone unit won't emit vo's.  [/i]
